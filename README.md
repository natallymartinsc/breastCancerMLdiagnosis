# Project: Enhancing Machine Learning Knowledge with Breast cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset 

## Project description:
This project aims to use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to apply and enhance Machine Learning concepts. The primary objective is to develop a model capable od diagnosing the presence of breast cancer based on the caracteristics of the cell nuclei present in biopsy image.

## Project objective:
Apply Machine Learning Concepts: Use the dataset to learn and implement Machine Learning algorithms, including preprocessing data, feature selection, model building, and evaluation
Enhance Data Science Skills: Practice techniques of exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and model validation

## Tools Used: 
Programming language: Python
Libaries: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
